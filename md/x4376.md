# 14.1. Upgrading 2.0.x to 2.0.y releases

Unless otherwise mentioned in the release notes, upgrading from one BDR
2.0.x minor release to another simply requires that the new extension be
installed in your postgres instance, followed by a PostgreSQL restart.
This is the same process as a PostgreSQL minor release update.
