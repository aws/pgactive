>1.3. Differences between BDR and trigger-based replication</A
></H1
><P
>   There are a number of trigger-based logical replication solutions for
   PostgreSQL, including
   <A
HREF="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/SkyTools"
TARGET="_top"
>Londiste</A
>,
   <A
HREF="http://slony.info/"
TARGET="_top"
>Slony-I</A
> and
   <A
HREF="https://bucardo.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>Bucardo</A
>. They're mature, fairly
   widely used and powerful, and like BDR they have the advantages (and
   disadvantages) of logical replication.
  </P
><P
>   As with the comparison with physical replication, BDR offers advantages
   over trigger-based replication solutions but also has some downsides.
  </P
><P
>   All trigger-based replication solutions suffer from inherent
   write-amplification, where each write to the database produces a
   corresponding write to a replication log table. Both the original write and
   the write to the replication log get recorded in WAL as well as the heap, so
   each write actually happens four times. By reading and processing WAL
   for data to replicate BDR avoids this write amplification, so writes
   to a BDR-replicated database only get written twice - like any other
   durable write on PostgreSQL.
  </P
><P
>   Trigger-based replication also requires an external d&aelig;mon process on
   the sending and/or receiving side. BDR runs its management processes
   inside PostgreSQL itself, so there's no separate replication process
   to manage.
  </P
><P
>   At the time of writing, systems like Londiste have a number of features for
   which BDR has no corresponding capability. Londiste can synchronise and
   compare tables between the publisher and subscriber. Slony-I supports
   events and confirmations. Slony-I provides infrastructure for handling
   DDL while also running on unmodified PostgreSQL 9.4. Bucardo supports
   multi-master on unmodified PostgreSQL 9.4. So while BDR offers some
   significant benefits it won't suit every need and every workload. Evaluate
   your needs carefully before choosing a technology.
